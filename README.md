# robot-car

## Things to accomplish
* Understand how to move the car
* Move the car (with remote control)
* Build obstacle course to test capabilites
* Autonomous movement through obstacle course


## Issues
* Left signal LEDs do not light up, diode is always reverse biased and never changes direction
* Connecting either IR sensor (top sensors) causes issues with uploading to robot, disconnect prior to uploading
* [FIXED] Motor controller does not send out signals to activate motors when correct inputs are given
